     Prioritizing cutting-edge speed and supporting the rapid growth of Hudson River Trading’s codebase can have unintended effects that require innovative solutions. For those working on our Python codebase, this means addressing “code tangling,” the coupling of unrelated code through unintuitive import cycles. In this article, George Farcasiu, Noah Kim, Jacob Brugh, and Jiahao Li discuss how they mitigate
     the cost and time burden of this issue by creating new tools to analyze and untangle dependencies efficientlyLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ratione, delectus ipsa. Libero eius saepe earum placeat
